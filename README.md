# Vegetable-Market-Management-System-PHP-MySQL-
LAXANAGORA is a small **web + database** project that models and manages the core operations of a vegetable market (“λαχαναγορά”).   It includes a **relational MySQL schema (ER-designed)** with realistic entities (producers, products, receipts/deliveries, customers, stores, etc.) and a simple **PHP dashboard** to perform basic management tasks.
